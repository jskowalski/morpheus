morpheus
========
morpheus is a horribly complex development pattern for building line-of-business hypermedia webApis and clients of hypermedia webApis. If you understood that bit, don’t worry, it gets worse. It’s meant to be a generic, resource unaware system that allows for client developer exploration, machine based resource discovery and user interface view management/load-out. You could call it a repleacement of SOAP to get the general idea. This is a development project by the ServiceMonster team for use in our "webApi FIRST" development initiative.

###The morpheus pattern contains four important parts
