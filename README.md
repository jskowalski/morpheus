morpheus
========
morpheus is a horribly complex development pattern for building line-of-business hypermedia webApis and clients. If you understood that bit, don’t worry, it gets worse. It’s meant to be a generic, resource unaware system that allows for client developer exploration, resource machine discovery, and user interface load-out. It’s fricken’ cool and some developers have left the project in fear we have started Skynet. This is a development project by the ServiceMonster.net team for use in their webApi FIRST platform initiative.
